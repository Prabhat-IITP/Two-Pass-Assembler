# Assembler and Emulator Project

This project includes an **assembler** and an **emulator** for developing, testing, and executing assembly programs. It supports assembling instructions, managing labels and mnemonics, and running the assembled code with options for memory inspection and tracing.

## Project Structure

### 1. Assembler

The assembler is designed with the following features to ensure efficiency, readability, and accuracy:

- **Data Structures**:  
  - **Label Table**: Stores labels with their respective addresses.
  - **Mnemonic Table**: Maintains mnemonics with expected operand formats.
  
- **Single Routine Pass**: Uses a single routine to perform both assembly passes for streamlined execution.

- **Error Detection**: Detects label errors for improved program correctness.

- **Consistent Formatting**: 
  - Code is formatted for readability, with sensible variable, function, and type names.
  - Includes explanatory comments for clarity.
  
- **Listing File**: Generates an advanced listing file to aid in debugging and program analysis.

- **Test Program Compatibility**: Capable of assembling test programs to verify functionality.

- **SET Instruction**: Supports and demonstrates the `SET` instruction for enhanced assembly control.

### 2. Emulator

The emulator provides a virtual environment to execute the assembled code, with debugging and analysis tools:

- **Data Structures**:
  - **Memory**: Stores program data and instructions for execution.
  - **Mnemonic Table**: Holds mnemonics with expected operand formats.
  
- **Object File Loader**: Loads object files generated by the assembler.

- **Memory Dump Options**:
  - `-before` / `-after`: Dumps memory contents before or after execution.

- **Trace Option**: 
  - `-trace`: Prints detailed execution results to track program flow.
  
- **Error Detection**: Identifies errant programs and outputs relevant information.

## Testing

- **Assembler Testing**: The assembler has been tested with two example programs, validating functionality and error-checking capabilities.

## Usage

### 1. Assembling a Program

To assemble a test program, pass it to the assembler. The assembler detects label errors and outputs a listing file.  

Example:
```bash
assembler example_program.asm
