Declaration of Authorship
Files:
*All the files I submitted, asm.cpp and emu.cpp and claims.txt, have my name and student id at the start, along with a declaration of authorship.

The evidence for Assembler including the output files from the two test examples have also been uploaded.

*Both of my cpp programs did not show any errors and warnings when I compiled it with g++ file.cpp

*Two programs are compilable with g++ asm.cpp -o asm and g++ emu.cpp -o emu.

Program format and structure:
1. The assembler:

	* with two data structures to store respectively labels and mnemonic table with expected operands.
	* uses a single routine for both passes.
	* detects label erros.
	* consistent and sensible formatting with sensible program structure. 
	* sensible variable, function & type names with explanatory comments.
	* advanced listing file.
	* assembles test programs.
	* can implements and demonstrates the instruction SET.

2. The emulator :

    * with two data structures to store respectively memory, mnemonic table with expected operands
    * loads object file, 
    * by giving the instructions like "-befor/-after" , the program can produce memory dump before/after execution.
    * by giving the instruction like "-trace", the program prints the result of program executed.
    * detects errant programs.


Testing:

1. The assembler: I have tested two examples.
